## Notebooks

### Analysis & Data Visualization (AVD)
Notebooks in this section cover techniques for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and generating insights from data.  
*Example topics: data cleaning, charting with Matplotlib/Seaborn, interactive plots with Plotly, etc.*

### Probability & Statistics
Here you will find notebooks focused on statistical methods, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and inferential statistics.

### Machine Learning
This section includes notebooks that demonstrate machine learning concepts, model building, evaluation, and more advanced techniques using popular libraries.

## Setup & Environment

These notebooks and accompanying scripts are designed to work in a Linux-based environment. To ensure smooth execution of your projects, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Activating the Virtual Environment
To activate the virtual environment, run:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
